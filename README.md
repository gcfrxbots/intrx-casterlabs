## How To Install
**Step 1:**
Download and install [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.9/python-3.7.9-amd64.exe "Python 3.7"). Make sure to add python to PATH while running the installer! 

**Step 2:**
Run the `Install_Requirements.bat` file located in the Setup folder. This will install any programs and dependcys required by IntRX. You can do this by simply double clicking on the .bat file.

**Step 3:**
Once the installer has finished you are ready to add your Casterlabs Auth key to `Settings.xlsx` Your auth key on the casterlabs beta can be found in 
`%appdata%/casterlabs-caffeinated/preferences/auth.json`

If you are not using the new Casterlabs beta you can get your key by pressing `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`I` and typing `CAFFEINATED.token` in the console. 

**Step 4:**
After the settings file has been saved with your casterlabs token you are ready to launch `IntRX.exe` and get started writing your bot. Bot documentation can be found on the [developer website](https://rxbots.net/ "developer website").
